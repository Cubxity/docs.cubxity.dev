# Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. This is the recommended metric driver and is
perfect for integrated environments like Kubernetes and Docker.

## Configuration

This is the default configuration for the Prometheus driver. **This is not the configuration for Prometheus.**

This file is located in one of these, depending on your platform:

- `plugins/UnifiedMetrics/driver/prometheus.yml`
- `plugins/unifiedmetrics/driver/prometheus.yml`
- `mods/UnifiedMetrics/driver/prometheus.yml`
- `config/unifiedmetrics/driver/prometheus.yml`

```yaml
# HTTP: Scrape via HTTP endpoint
# PUSHGATEWAY: Pushes to a remote PushGateway server. THIS IS *NOT* remote_write!
mode: "HTTP"

# Applies to "HTTP" mode.
http:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  # The default in 0.4.x will be 9970.
  # Note that this port needs to match the port that you have allocated
  port: 9100
  authentication:
    # Authentication is encouraged when using a shared host or when exposing the endpoint publicly
    # NONE: Authentication disabled
    # BASIC: Username/password authentication
    scheme: "NONE"
    username: "username"
    password: "password"

# Applies to "PUSHGATEWAY" mode.
# Note that this is NOT compatible with remote_write.
pushGateway:
  job: "unifiedmetrics"
  url: "http://pushgateway:9091"
  authentication:
    # NONE: Authentication disabled
    # BASIC: Username/password authentication
    scheme: "BASIC"
    username: "username"
    password: "password"
  # The push interval in seconds
  interval: 10
```

## Networking

### Pterodactyl (same host)

If you are using Pterodactyl and are planning to monitor it from the same host, create a local allocation (`127.0.0.1`)
in the panel. **Ensure that the port you allocate matches the one in the configuration**.

![Pterodactyl Allocation](/img/unifiedmetrics/pterodactyl-allocation.png)

Then, configure your firewall (if applicable). This should not apply to shared hosts.

:::warning Warning

The following command will allow **any server** on the node to access the opened port. This may allow a malicious server
on the node to perform a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on your server.

**UFW (Debian/Ubuntu):**

```bash
# Make sure to replace 9100 with the port you configured
# The ip address may be different depending on your configuration (check ip a)
$ sudo ufw allow in on pterodactyl0 to 172.18.0.1 port 9100 proto tcp
```

:::

### Pterodactyl (multi-host)

Create a node port allocation (e.g. `0.0.0.0`) with the configured UnifiedMetrics port and apply it to the server. **
This is highly discouraged and should be avoided when possible.**

:::warning Warning

Exposing UnifiedMetrics publicly (`0.0.0.0`) may allow attackers to perform Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on your
server. Secure your endpoint by applying authentication, firewall, and/or VPN tunnels.

:::

### Other deployment solutions

Simply bind UnifiedMetrics' port to a private network interface or public interface **(NOT RECOMMENDED)**. Make sure
that you allow Prometheus to communicate with the server.

:::warning Warning

Exposing UnifiedMetrics publicly (`0.0.0.0`) may allow attackers to perform Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on your
server. Secure your endpoint by applying authentication, firewall, and/or VPN tunnels.

## Grafana Cloud

Grafana Cloud offers a free hosted Grafana instance and Prometheus instance. This is useful for small servers.

[**Set up Grafana Cloud Â»**](../guides/grafana#grafana-cloud)

:::info Note

You **need to host** your own Prometheus/Grafana Agent to push metrics to Grafana Cloud.

## Installing Prometheus

Prometheus can be installed in multiple ways, depending on your environment.

<details>
  <summary>Grafana Agent (Docker Compose)</summary>

**Pros:**

- Declarative configuration
- Integrates nicely with existing Minecraft containers
- Perfect for `remote_write`

**Cons:**

- Can be confusing for beginners

First, install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/) on your server. Then create a compose file
somewhere, like `~/.deployment/metrics/docker-compose.yml`.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml

version: "3"

services:
  agent:
    image: grafana/agent:latest
    restart: always
    container_name: agent
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    volumes:
      - ./agent.yml:/etc/agent-config/agent.yml
    entrypoint:
      - /bin/agent
      - -config.file=/etc/agent-config/agent.yml
      - -prometheus.wal-directory=/tmp/agent/wal
    networks:
      # Change this to "pterodactyl_nw" and external to true IF you are using Pterodactyl
      - prometheus

networks:
  # Change this to "pterodactyl_nw" and external to true IF you are using Pterodactyl
  prometheus:
    external: true
```

Then create a network **if you are NOT USING Pterodactyl**.

```bash
$ docker network create prometheus
```

Finally, run `docker compose up -d --remove-orphans` to start Grafana Agent.

```bash
$ cd ~/.deployment/metrics
$ docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
```

We'll not start Grafana Agent yet, since we need to [configure](#configuring-prometheus) it first.

      - data-prometheus:/prometheus

networks:

<details>
  <summary>Prometheus (Pterodactyl)</summary>

**Pros:**

- Easy to set up
- Integrates nicely with your existing servers

**Cons:**

- Some shared hosts may not support it

First, start by importing the [Prometheus egg](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs/tree/master/monitoring/prometheus) in
your panel. Then, create a new server with the egg.

Finally, start and stop the server. We'll need to [configure](#configuring-prometheus) it first.

:::warning Warning

The Prometheus egg has web interface **enabled by default**. This may pose security risks if not configured properly.

## Configuring Prometheus

There are multiple configurations possible for Prometheus. Some configurations may fit your environment better than
others. **Please read the comments on the configuration file**.

<details>
  <summary>Prometheus</summary>

**Docker Compose:**

This file should be located in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.

```yaml
# prometheus.yml

global:
  scrape_interval: 10s

scrape_configs:
  # Create as many jobs as you'd like
  - job_name: "smp-1"
    static_configs:
      # Replace this with the IP address or hostname of your server
      # This will be the service name for Docker Compose users
      - targets: [ "172.18.0.1:9100" ]
        # Customize or/and rewrite your labels (optional)
        labels:
          # The instance label will be shown on the dashboard
          # This is the server's IP address by default
          instance: "smp-1.node1.local"

    # Remove this section if you are not using BASIC authentication
    basic_auth:
      username: "username"
      password: "password"

# Remove this section if you are not using remote_write
# Create a new API key if you are using Grafana Cloud
remote_write:
  - url: https://prometheus-us-central1.grafana.net/api/prom/push
    basic_auth:
      username: 12345
      password: "insert_api_token_here"

```

Finally, start Prometheus.

**Docker Compose:**

```bash
$ cd ~/.deployment/metrics
$ docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Grafana Agent</summary>

**Docker Compose:**

This file should be located in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.

```yaml
# agent.yml

prometheus:
  global:
    scrape_interval: 10s
  configs:
    - name: minecraft
      host_filter: false
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: "smp-1"

          # Remove this section if you are not using BASIC authentication
          basic_auth:
            username: "username"
            password: "password"

      # Create an account at https://grafana.com/ and create an organization, if you are using Grafana Cloud.
      # Put Prometheus remote write credentials here. Make sure to update the push URL to match yours.
      remote_write:
        - url: https://prometheus-us-central1.grafana.net/api/prom/push
          # Create an API key with write scope on Grafana Cloud
          basic_auth:
            username: 12345
            password: "insert_api_key_here"
```

Finally, start Grafana Agent.
